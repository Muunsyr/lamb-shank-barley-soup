- 2 cloves crushed garlic
- 2 diced carrots
- 4 sticks diced celery
- 4 diced creme gold potatoes
- 1 litres beef stock
- 500ml litre water
- 1 1/4 cup pearl barley
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary
- 1/2 teaspoon finely chopped fresh rosemary

## Method
### Step 1:
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan and brown the trimmed lamb shanks.
Remove and set aside.
Add the chopped onions, garlic, carrots, potatoes and celery and cook for 5 minutes or until lightly browned.

### Step 2:
Return the shanks to the pan and add all the beef stock, water, barley and the 2 tablespoons of chopped fresh rosemary.
Bring to the boil then reduce the heat to low and simmer, covered, for 2 hours (to make lamb nice and tender, ensure it isn't boiling).

### Step 3:
Remove the shanks and cool slightly.
Take the meat off the bone and flake into pieces.
Return the meat to the soup and add the remaining finely chopped rosemary.
Season to taste and serve.
Freeze remaining soup in airtight containers.
